# Radiation-Therapy-Optimization
## Mathematical Model to optimize beam intensity levels for treatment of cancer
### All input files are located in the folder necessary project files
### Programming is done in AMPL and visualization is done in MAPLE software
### Place .mod,.dat and .run files in ampl 
### Copy and paste maplescript with respective file names to visualize resultant beams intensities
### You can improve this model by various engineered approches and share them on github
